		<h3>Basketball and Video games</h3>
		<span></span>
		<br>
		<p>My hobbies are quite simple and only a few, two to be exact.<br> As a kid, I was always a fan of video games, loved doing it to entertain myself, relieve stress, waste my time and have fun. so till i grew up, till this day, I still carry this hobby of mine. <br> Basketball was first just for fun, in the streets, mess around with friends. But there was something about it that got me attached, to dedicate myself and to chase a goal. From playing for fun to making it a part of my day to day life, I am inlove with that sport. </p>
